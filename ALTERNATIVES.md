# **Beyond ARS: Alternative Use Cases for Agora**

While **Agora** was initially designed as an Audience Response System (ARS), its core mechanics—real-time, anonymous or semi-anonymous text submission with centralized host control—make it a surprisingly versatile platform. The ability to quickly gather, group, and display text-based input from an audience opens up a world of possibilities beyond simple Q\&A.  
This document explores some of these alternative use cases to inspire new ways of using the tool.

### **1\. Social Games and Icebreakers**

Leverage anonymity and real-time feedback to create engaging social games perfect for presentations, workshops, or friendly gatherings.

- **"Cards Against Humanity" / Fill-in-the-Blank Games:** The host provides a prompt with a blank space (the "black card"). Participants anonymously submit their most creative or humorous answers (the "white cards"). The host can then reveal all submissions and let the audience vote for the winner.
- **"Who Said It?" Quote Quiz:** The host presents a famous quote, and participants submit the name of the person they believe said it. The bar chart view provides an instant, fun visualization of the most popular (and incorrect) guesses, sparking discussion.
- **Group Storytelling (Chain Story):** The host starts a story with a single sentence. In subsequent rounds, participants submit the next sentence. The host chooses the most compelling submission, reveals it to the group, and uses it as the prompt for the next round. The semi-anonymous mode would allow everyone to see the creative contributions of "Plato" or "Socrates."
- **"Dictionary" / Fictionary Game:** The host provides a rare and obscure word. Each participant invents and submits a plausible definition. The host then presents all the fake definitions along with the real one. Participants vote on which definition they believe is correct. Points can be awarded for guessing correctly or for having others vote for your fake definition.
- **"Who's Who?" Guessing Game:** At the end of a session run in semi-anonymous mode, the host can initiate a final game round: "Who do you think was _Aristotle_ this whole time?". Participants submit their guesses, leading to a fun reveal and discussion.

### **2\. Collaboration and Brainstorming Tools**

Use the safety of anonymity to foster honest and unfiltered collaboration in a professional setting.

- **Agile Sprint Retrospectives:** A development team can use Agora for a classic agile ceremony. The host sets up rounds for "What went well?", "What could we improve?", and "Action items." Team members submit their points anonymously, encouraging complete honesty, especially on sensitive topics. The host can then use the drag-and-drop feature to group similar themes for discussion.
- **Anonymous Brainstorming:** When tackling a complex problem, use Agora to gather ideas without the filter of self-consciousness. Participants can submit any idea that comes to mind, free from the fear of judgment. The word cloud view would be an excellent way to quickly identify recurring concepts.
- **Team Task Prioritization (Dot Voting):** The host lists several candidate features or tasks. Each participant is given a limited number of "votes" (e.g., 3\) and submits the names of the tasks they want to vote for. The bar chart instantly shows which items have the most team support.

### **3\. Interactive Education and Training**

Transform passive learning into an active and engaging experience.

- **Anonymous Peer Review:** In a creative writing, code review, or design workshop, the instructor can have students submit a short piece of their work. The submissions are then displayed to the group one-by-one (using sequential reveal), allowing everyone to provide constructive feedback without knowing the author's identity, which helps eliminate bias.
- **Diagnostic Simulations:** In medical, technical, or business training, the host describes a complex scenario (e.g., a patient's symptoms, a system failure, a market crisis). Trainees submit their proposed diagnosis or plan of action. The host can then use the different submissions to discuss various lines of reasoning and outcomes.

### **4\. Real-time Decision Making and Feedback**

Gather instant, honest feedback to guide meetings, events, or decision-making processes.

- **Quick Confidential Voting:** For sensitive topics in board meetings or community gatherings where a show of hands could be influenced by social pressure. Agora ensures that each individual's true opinion is registered privately and counted accurately.
- **"Pulse Check" / Instant Feedback:** During a long conference or multi-day event, the host can pause and ask questions like, "What has been the most valuable topic so far?" or "What question is still on your mind?". The anonymous responses provide honest, real-time feedback that can help the presenter adjust the remainder of the event to better meet the audience's needs.

The core of **Agora** is an engine for social interaction. We encourage you to experiment and discover new and creative ways to use it\!
